        Summary 
        </h2>
    <p>
    This is the first page of the websites I've created so far.<br>
    Honestly have nothing to say, just putting up the designs to <br>
    see my knowledge so far in this journey. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And honestly I want to thank all the people who are helping <br>
        in this journey. From the Boss <span>Mr. Wahab</span> to all my <br>
        seniors. I'm really grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the right side are the links to the website I created this week. <br>
        Starting this on <span>January 11th, 2024</span>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first website <span>Facebook,</span> shown there is actually how <span>Facebook</span> <br>
        Homepage used to look like wayback in 2010, that's when I created <br> my first facebook 
        account. <br>
        I recreated that to test my knowledge in this <span>Web Developing</span> so far <br> but i attached couple of things
        in it that wasn't part of how the old <br> facebook homepage used to look like.
